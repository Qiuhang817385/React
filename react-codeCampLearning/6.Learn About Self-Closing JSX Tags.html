            在闭合标签的概念当中
            In HTML, almost all tags have both an opening and closing tag: <div></div>
            For example the line-break tag can be written as <br> or as <br />, but should never be written 
            as <br></br>, since it doesn't contain any content.

            In JSX, the rules are a little different

            Any JSX element can be written with a self-closing tag, and every element must be closed

            
            The line-break tag, for example, must always be written as <br />

            in order to be valid JSX that can be transpiled
            可以保证JSX被有效转换


            on the other hand, can be written as <div /> or <div></div>.
